# socdevbayes: Introduction to Bayesian Analyses for Social Development

This repository contains the slides and code for the presentation materials and example Bayesian analyses for the PSY311 guest lecture by Rebekah Gelpi and William Ai. The `socdevbayes.html` file has a handout describing the analyses and visualizations used in the presentation, while the `socdevbayes.Rmd` file can be imported into RStudio and freely modified or added to for those interested in using the analyses given.

### To run the code

1. Download R (<https://cran.r-project.org/>) and RStudio (<https://rstudio.com/>), if not already downloaded.
2. Open the R markdown file (`socdevbayes.Rmd`) using RStudio.
3. Code chunks within the R Markdown project can be run using the Run All Chunks option (⌘⌥R on Mac, or Ctrl+Alt+R on Windows), or by using the green arrow beside each chunk to run individually. Note that the first chunk is the setup chunk and must be run first.
